==================

This exercise includes implementation of several linear as well as nonlinear
recursive functions. For each implementation we had to understand two
important elements of the algorithm: the base case, and the recursive call.

Some of the functions implemented:
- A solution of the tower of hanoi.
- Calculation of an exponent.
- Finding all possible sequence combinations of characters.
