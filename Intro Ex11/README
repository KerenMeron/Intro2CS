In this exercise we implemented 2nd order programming. The main mind
switch we made for this project was viewing functions as objects. We did
this by programming functions which returned and also accepted as parameters,
other functions.

The project includes mathematical functions which calculate trig values,
integrals, derivatives, etc. Some of the functions required a mathematical
understanding, and partial use of proofs from calculus. We also graphed
several functions, with great use of several functions composition.
