==================

In this exercise we made first use of OOP in python programming, by writing
code for a game of battleships.

The game structure:
In each turn the user places a bomb on the board, and each ship moves one
space in its direction. Each bomb has 3 lives on the board, and if all cells
of a ship hit bombs, the ship is terminated. Game over when all ships are
terminated.

Code:
We made use of classes in this exercises:
1. Direction - a static class, for defining the direction constants which
    will be used in ship and game classes.
2. Ship - with attributes such as position, direction, length, etc. Implements
    several functions which change the ship's state and position, and checks
    different elements such as the cells' state.
3. Game - implements game procedure, such as moving ships and placing bombs
    on the board. With attributes such as the ships in the game and a
    dictionary of bombs on the board.
