==================

In this exercise we were required to create a graphic user interface, and
also practice connecting to a server.
We created an interface on which a user can draw shapes on in different
colors. Each user joins a group, in which the drawing canvas displays shapes
drawn by all users in group.

We had our first (and hopefully not last) encounter with tkinter, and learned
different syntax ways to design and create an interface. In addition we
managed to form a connection with a server.

All this was done using object oriented programming; we had a class for the
interface and a class for the client which was in charge of connectivity.
We had to plan this project thoroughly and use our creative skills in
designing the interface.
