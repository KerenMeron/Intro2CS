==================
=  Description:  =
==================

This exercise deals with data bases, dictionaries and XML files.

A program designed to compare item prices from different stores.
The user can load XML files (supplied by the store) containing a data
structure of items and their properties from a chosen store.
The user can load several lists into the the program, and select different
items which s/he is interested in comparing.
The program will find the cheapest store for the user to shop at, by
calculating the sum of the prices of all chosen items. If a store does not
have a certain item, it will receive a fine to add to the prices sum. The
fine will be 125% of the most expensive price of the item out of all stores.
Other features include the option to save the formed shopping cart, and
reload a cart previously saved.
