CONVERT_SPOON_TO_CUP
Using a unit conversion, accepts a measurement in spoons
and converts it to cups.

CALCULATE_MATHEMATICAL_EXPRESSION
Contains two functions:
1. Accepts two numbers and a math operations, and solves
	the given mathematical expression.
2. Accepts a string containing a mathematical expression.
	Extracts the numbers and operation in the expression,
	and uses the first function to calculate the expression.

LARGEST_AND_SMALLEST
Accepts 3 numbers, and using a for loop,
finds the minimal and maximal values.

QUADRATIC_EQUATION
Contains two functions:
1. Accepts three numbers which are the coefficients of a quadratic equation.
	Decides how many solutions exist to the	equation,
	and then uses the quadratic formula to find those.
2. Accepts from the user three numbers. Uses the first function
 	to calculate the solutions of the quadratic equations which
 	has those numbers as coefficients.

SHAPES
Contains 4 functions:
1. Calculates the area of a circle from a given radius.
2. Calculates the area of a rectangle from two given sides.
3. Calculates the area of a trapezoid from two given bases
 	and a given height.
4. Asks the user to pick a shape out of the three mentioned
 	above, and then calls upon the relevant function to
	calculate the shape's area. To do so, the user must
	input the relevant lengths of the chosen shape.

BMI
Accepts two parameters, and calculates a 'bmi' value according
to a certain formula. Then checks if the 'bmi' is between certain
limits, according to which returns True or False.

======================

For the BODEK:
When I sometimes called another function with parameters,
I used the same variable names inside the function
and when calling the function.

For example, if I defined a function;
	def function (var1, var2):
And then called on it like so:
	function (var1, var2)
Instead of:
	function (var3, var4)


I wanted to point out that I am aware that these DO NOT have
to be similar in order to call, but I decided to do so
nonetheless (coding style).
I hope my meaning was understood, just wanted to make sure
points weren't taken off for this.
